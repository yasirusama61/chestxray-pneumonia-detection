## 📈 Model Comparison: Custom CNN vs DenseNet121 (Transfer Learning)

We trained and evaluated two models on the Chest X-ray Pneumonia dataset:

- ✅ A custom CNN trained from scratch  
- ✅ A transfer learning model using **DenseNet121** pretrained on ImageNet

---

### 🔬 Evaluation Metrics

| Metric              | Custom CNN       | DenseNet121 (Transfer Learning) |
|---------------------|------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Test Accuracy**   | ~96%             | **87%**                         |
| **ROC AUC**         | 0.9600           | **0.9481**                      |

---

### 📊 DenseNet121 – Evaluation Results

![DenseNet121 Evaluation](assets/densenet_eval.png)

![Classification Report](assets/densenet_classification_report.png)

- **Confusion Matrix** and ROC curve show reliable classification performance.
- **Classification Report** shows strong recall for PNEUMONIA class (0.94), with slightly lower recall on NORMAL class (0.75).
- F1-score balances out at **0.90 (Pneumonia)** and **0.81 (Normal)**.

---

### 🧠 Insight

Despite being a powerful pretrained architecture, DenseNet121 slightly underperformed the custom CNN on this dataset. This may be due to:
- The relatively small dataset size
- The model being frozen during training (not fine-tuned)

---

### 🛠️ Next Steps

- ✅ Grad-CAM visualization for DenseNet121
- 🔁 Fine-tune top layers of DenseNet for better generalization
- 📦 Package the best model into a web demo or API

### 🎯 Confidence Threshold Analysis

To better understand the model's behavior across different decision thresholds, we plotted **Precision and Recall vs Confidence Threshold**.

This helps identify optimal thresholds based on the application's needs — for example, prioritizing **recall** in a medical setting to minimize false negatives.

![Confidence Curve](assets/densenet_confidence_curve.png)

- As expected, **precision increases** and **recall decreases** as confidence threshold rises.
- The default threshold of 0.5 (dashed line) represents a good balance, but the curve allows threshold tuning for specific use cases.

### 🎯 Threshold Optimization with Youden's Index

To improve decision-making beyond the default threshold (0.5), we applied **Youden's J statistic** to determine the optimal classification threshold.

- 📌 **Optimal Threshold (Youden's Index):** `0.7653`
- This threshold balances **recall and specificity** and is suitable for medical screening where minimizing false positives is important.

---

#### 📋 Classification Report @ Threshold = 0.7653

| Class      | Precision | Recall | F1-score | Support |
|------------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| NORMAL     | 0.82      | 0.91   | 0.86     | 234     |
| PNEUMONIA  | 0.94      | 0.88   | 0.91     | 390     |
| **Accuracy**     |       |        | **0.89** | 624     |

- Macro F1: **0.89**  
- Weighted F1: **0.89**

---

![Youden Confusion Matrix](assets/youden_confusion_matrix.png)

Compared to the default threshold:
- ✅ **Precision increased**, especially for pneumonia
- ✅ **Balanced trade-off** between sensitivity and specificity
- 🚀 Improved overall model reliability for deployment scenarios

### 🔄 Before vs After Applying Youden’s Threshold (0.7653)

We compared the model's evaluation metrics using the **default threshold (0.5)** and the **optimized threshold (0.7653)** obtained via **Youden’s Index**.

| Metric               | Threshold = 0.5   | Threshold = 0.7653 |
|----------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Accuracy**         | 0.87             | **0.89**            |
| **Precision (Normal)** | 0.88           | **0.82**            |
| **Recall (Normal)**    | 0.75           | **0.91**            |
| **Precision (Pneumonia)** | 0.86       | **0.94**            |
| **Recall (Pneumonia)**    | 0.94       | **0.88**            |
| **F1-Score (Normal)**    | 0.81         | **0.86**            |
| **F1-Score (Pneumonia)** | 0.90         | **0.91**            |
| **Macro F1**         | 0.85             | **0.89**            |

✅ **Youden's threshold** improved **overall accuracy and F1-score**, especially by increasing the **recall of the NORMAL class** (reducing false positives for pneumonia).  
It's a strong alternative to the default threshold when aiming for **more reliable classification** in clinical or real-world applications.

### 🧮 Youden’s Index Curve

We calculated **Youden’s Index** across a range of thresholds to identify the point that best balances sensitivity (recall) and specificity.

![Youden Curve](assets/youden_index_curve.png)

- The peak occurs at **threshold = 0.7653**
- This threshold yielded the highest **Youden’s J (≈ 0.79)**, meaning it provides the most balanced classification
- This threshold was then used for post-optimization evaluation (see results above)

### 🩻 Grad-CAM Visualization (DenseNet121)

We used Grad-CAM to visualize the model’s attention while predicting chest X-rays using the **DenseNet121** model.

This helps us verify whether the model is focusing on medically relevant regions (lungs, opacities) when making decisions.

![Grad-CAM DenseNet](assets/gradcam_densenet.png)

**Observations:**
- ✅ **Correct NORMAL predictions** focus on clear lung regions, with lower confidence heat.
- ✅ **Correct PNEUMONIA predictions** show strong activation around infiltrates or opacities, often in lower lungs.
- ✅ The model shows consistent and localized attention, increasing trust in its predictions.

This visualization supports the model's interpretability and is helpful for clinical validation or decision support systems.

### ⚠️ Misclassification Analysis (Grad-CAM)

We also investigated misclassified examples using Grad-CAM to understand where the model's attention was focused when it made incorrect predictions.

Below is an example where the model **incorrectly predicted "PNEUMONIA"** with high confidence (0.97), while the ground truth label was **"NORMAL"**:

![Misclassified Grad-CAM](assets/misclassified_normal_pred_pneumonia.png)

**Observation:**
- The model concentrated on a region in the **right mid-to-lower lung**, where it might have interpreted tissue texture or slight opacity as abnormal.
- This could be:
  - 🔬 A **subtle radiological feature** that resembles pneumonia (but isn’t)
  - ⚠️ A **false positive due to over-sensitivity**, especially after optimizing for high recall
  - 🧠 Or a **labeling inconsistency** — it might not be 100% "normal" (annotation noise is common in real X-ray datasets)

This highlights the importance of Grad-CAM in **interpreting model behavior** and identifying **clinical edge cases**.

### 🩺 Expert Review: False Positive and False Negative Analysis

To ensure clinical validity, we reviewed misclassified samples using Grad-CAM overlays to interpret model behavior, particularly focusing on false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN).

---

#### 🔍 False Positives (Predicted: PNEUMONIA | Ground Truth: NORMAL)

![False Positives Panel](assets/misclassified_fp_panel.png)

**Clinical Interpretation:**

- The model focused on the **mid-to-lower lung zones** in most FP cases — common sites for pneumonia, suggesting the model is aligned with radiological intuition.
- Several cases showed **vascular markings or rib overlaps** that the model may have mistaken for infiltrates.
- In at least one case, **faint soft-tissue opacity** could potentially represent a real abnormality not labeled — raising the possibility of **labeling noise** in the dataset.
- These findings are **acceptable false alarms** in a triage setting where sensitivity is prioritized.

---

#### 🚨 False Negatives (Predicted: NORMAL | Ground Truth: PNEUMONIA)

![False Negatives Panel](assets/misclassified_fn_panel.png)

**Clinical Interpretation:**

- Some missed cases had **diffuse or very subtle opacities** — likely to be overlooked without clinical correlation or lateral views.
- Grad-CAM heatmaps showed **low activation in lung zones**, indicating that the model may not have perceived enough structural irregularity to trigger a pneumonia classification.
- These false negatives reflect limitations in capturing **early or atypical presentations**, suggesting a need for:
  - Further training on mild pneumonia cases
  - Augmentation of borderline samples
  - Or integration with clinical metadata for better context

---

### 💬 Summary

The Grad-CAM analysis provides confidence that the model is:
- Focusing on **medically relevant lung areas**
- Making **interpretable errors** consistent with clinical ambiguity
- Likely to benefit from **post-processing** (e.g., soft voting or threshold tuning) to reduce false negatives in real-world deployment

Overall, the model shows behavior **aligned with radiological patterns**, and the interpretability pipeline strengthens its potential for clinical application.

## 🧠 Model Architecture: CNN + Transformer Hybrid

We implemented a **hybrid deep learning model** that combines the strengths of convolutional layers (for local spatial features) and Transformer attention (for global context reasoning).

---

### 🔗 Architecture Flow (Sequential Hybrid)

The model structure is **sequential**, where:

1. **CNN Backbone** extracts spatial features:
   - 3 convolutional layers with increasing depth (32 → 64 → 128)
   - MaxPooling layers reduce spatial dimensions

2. **Transformer Encoder Block** processes reshaped CNN feature maps:
   - Reshape → sequence of tokens
   - Multi-Head Self Attention + LayerNorm
   - Final embedding via Dense layer

3. **Classification Head**:
   - GlobalAveragePooling + Dense layers
   - Binary sigmoid output for pneumonia prediction

📌 This design allows the Transformer to operate on high-level CNN features, enabling context-aware decision-making while preserving spatial inductive biases.

> ⚠️ Note: This is a **sequential hybrid**, not a parallel architecture. The Transformer block processes CNN-derived features rather than learning from raw input in parallel.

| **Balanced Diagnosis Model**     | 🔸 DenseNet121         |
| **Resource-Constrained Deployment** | 🔹 Basic CNN         |

---

### 📌 Notes

- All models were trained and tested on the **Chest X-ray (Pneumonia)** dataset.
- Each was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, AUC, and confusion matrix.
- Grad-CAM visualizations were used to interpret model focus for both correct and misclassified cases.
- ROC & confusion plots were saved under `/assets` for comparison.

### 🔄 Retraining Results (Resume from Checkpoint)

After continuing training the CNN + Transformer model from the saved checkpoint (`cnn_transformer_best.keras`) for 100 more epochs, we observed improved generalization:

- ✅ **AUC (NORMAL)** increased from 0.9482 → **0.9550**
- ✅ **AUC (PNEUMONIA)** increased from 0.9482 → **0.9550**
- ✅ **Normal Recall** improved from 0.74 → **0.79**
- ✅ **Pneumonia Precision** improved from 0.86 → **0.89**
- 🔁 Slight trade-off in Pneumonia Recall (0.97 → 0.95), but overall better balance

This shows that **resuming from a strong checkpoint** and training further can help:
- Reduce underfitting in early stages
- Sharpen model attention (confirmed by Grad-CAM++)
- Improve AUC and decision calibration

🧪 We recommend fine-tuning in 2 stages:
1. Train to baseline → Save best checkpoint
2. Resume from best checkpoint → Boost generalization


## 🔬 Grad-CAM++ Visualizations (CNN + Transformer)

To better understand what the CNN + Transformer model is focusing on during predictions, we applied **Grad-CAM++** on correctly classified test images.

This helped us visualize **model attention across lung fields**, especially in high-confidence cases.

---

### ✅ Results: Examples

![GradCAM++ CNN+Transformer](assets/gradcampp_cnn_transformer.png)

| True Label | Predicted | Confidence | Observation |
|------------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **NORMAL** | NORMAL    | 0.18       | Weak, scattered activation — no strong features detected |
| **NORMAL** | NORMAL    | 0.44       | Slight attention near ribs/clavicle, not lung infiltrates |
| **PNEUMONIA** | PNEUMONIA | 0.98     | Strong focus in lower/mid-lung — expected pneumonia zone |
| **PNEUMONIA** | PNEUMONIA | 1.00     | Whole-lung saturated activation — strong evidence, but may indicate overconfidence in severe cases |

---

### 🩺 Clinical Insight

- **NORMAL cases**: Weak or localized activation → suggests model does not falsely over-interpret normal structures.
- **PNEUMONIA cases**: Strong focus on lower or central lung regions aligns well with radiological findings.
- In very confident predictions (1.00), the activation sometimes spreads across the entire lung field — typical for severe infections but worth reviewing further.

---

### 🧠 Why Grad-CAM++?

Grad-CAM++ improves upon Grad-CAM by:
- Using **second-order gradients**
- Producing **sharper, better localized heatmaps**
- Revealing **fine-grained** decision cues, especially in medical imaging

---

### 🛠 Next Step

We plan to:
- Run Grad-CAM++ on **misclassified cases** (false positives & false negatives)
- Compare with basic Grad-CAM and Score-CAM for further validation
